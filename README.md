In order to run the tests on windows I've created Firefox.bat and chrome.bat, so you can run the tests in both browsers, if you don't use windows, then just use the maven command line from bat files.

It's not a good practice, but I've added the reports, if you wanna have a quick look at failures.

I would consider a bug the fact that no confirmation message is displayed, and of course the obviously bug when the email field is not proper validated and throws an error which was NOT catch(it's visible in the report).
